# Background: Student Co-op vs New Grad Interventions in Youth Employment Policy

Youth unemployment/underemployment is a persistent economic and social issue in Nova Scotia and across Canada. Young people often face a “no experience, no job” cycle, where employers seek prior work experience even for entry-level roles, making entry to the labour market difficult for recent graduates. Co-operative education and other work-integrated learning (WIL) programs aim to bridge this gap by embedding paid work experience within post-secondary education, giving students relevant work skills and networks before graduation (Statistics Canada, 2016; Wyonch, 2023). 

Conversely, wage subsidies targeted at early career graduates, such as the Graduate to Opportunity (GTO) program in Nova Scotia seek to address unemployment after graduation by reducing hiring costs for employers and incentivizing the retention of local talent (Nova Scotia Government, n.d.-a). Such subsidies can help recent graduates secure their first full-time job and potentially anchor them in the province’s labour force. 

Because early experiences significantly shape career trajectories, both approaches pre-graduation experience and post-graduation compensation have implications for long-term employment outcomes, economic growth, and youth retention in the province (Wyonch, 2023).

## What Makes This Decision Difficult

The key tension lies between short-term employment access and long-term job readiness and career alignment. Wage subsidies for recent graduates provide an immediate financial incentive for employers to hire and retain young workers. For example, Nova Scotia’s GTO program reimburses 25 % of the first year’s salary and 12.5 % of the second year’s salary for eligible graduates, helping new graduates secure their first jobs (Nova Scotia Government, n.d.-a). 

However, critics of wage subsidies often note that without significant work experience or skill development, graduates may still struggle to find meaningful employment that aligns with their field of study or long-term aspirations. Meanwhile, co-op and WIL programs integrate classroom learning with practical work terms that can help students to learn relevant work and shape their future career goals. National research suggests that students participating in co-ops and other WIL programs have higher employment rates and earnings after graduation compared to non-participants, and are more often employed in roles aligned with their training (Wyonch, 2023). 
Despite these benefits, co-ops can be resource-intensive for employers and institutions, require coordination between academic calendars and workplaces, and may not scale easily to all fields or smaller communities. Employers sometimes report challenges in supervision and administrative burden associated with structured work terms (Employment and Social Development Canada, n.d.).

## Key Stakeholders

•	Recent Graduates and Students: Primary beneficiaries; their long-term career outcomes and financial security hinge on employment access and quality of experience.
•	Employers: Small, medium, and large employers weigh costs and benefits of hiring subsidized graduates vs. investing time in co-op supervision.
•	Post-Secondary Institutions: Partners in co-op/WIL delivery; they influence program availability and quality.
•	Government Departments: The Department of Labour and Skills & Immigration must balance budget constraints, labour market needs, and equity goals.
•	Underrepresented Populations: Indigenous youth, racialized youth, persons with disabilities, and other groups often face additional employment barriers and benefit from targeted supports. 

## Current and Past Approaches
Nova Scotia’s current programs include both wage subsidies and co-op supports (Nova Scotia Government, n.d. a,b,c):

•	Graduate to Opportunity (GTO): Salary subsidies to employers hiring recent graduates to promote retention and workforce integration. 
•	Co-operative Education Incentive: Wage assistance for employers offering structured co-op work terms as part of academic programs. 
•	Student Summer Skills Incentive (SKILL): Subsidies for summer jobs, including work-integrated placements, targeting students. 

Evaluations of Canada’s broader Youth Employment and Skills Strategy indicate that wage subsidies and experiential learning supports are linked with higher employment rates and earnings for young participants compared to non-participants. However, outcomes can vary by type of intervention and target group.

This might be tough to get data on releated to successes on co-op vs other.  Jane MacDonald might have something she can share.
